· HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.

·More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

·The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

·HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.

·One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
