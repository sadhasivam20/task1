·Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

.An object is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

 ·Otherway around, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.

 ·These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties.

 ·A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is the property name value can be anything
